                    Playing violent video games may not necessarily determine violent 
                    or aggressive behavior, it may increase precursors to violent behavior. 
                    In fact, Dr. Olson points out that violent video games may be related to bullying, 
                    which researchers have found to be a risk factor for more serious violent behavior.

                    Analysis of 28 global studies dating back to 2008 found a minuscule positive correlation
                    The researchers, led by Aaron Drummond from New Zealand’s Massey University, 
                    re-examined 28 studies from previous years that looked at the link between aggressive 
                    behaviour and video gaming, a method known as a meta-analysis.
                    The new report, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science on Wednesday, 
                    found that, when bundled together, the studies showed a statistically significant but 
                    minuscule positive correlation between gaming and aggression, below the threshold required 
                    to count as even a “small effect”.
